# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub – Joseph Brzezowski

Hello, I’m Joseph Brzezowski – a Deaf tech entrepreneur, web hosting expert, and the founder of **AvocadoWeb Services LLC**, a Deaf-owned company focused on cloud hosting, WordPress innovation, accessibility tools, and AI for the Deaf community.

## 💼 What I Do

I run **AvocadoWeb Services LLC** – a company that proudly represents what’s possible when Deaf business owners take charge of building the future. We deliver premium web services powered by AWS, develop custom WordPress plugins, and create AI-driven solutions designed to make accessibility real — not just theoretical.

### Current Focus:
- Hosting & managing scalable **AWS cloud environments**
- Building **privacy-first** and **accessible** WordPress plugins
- Developing tools that empower the **Deaf and hard-of-hearing**
- Exploring **AI + AR** to improve real-time communication access

## 🔌 Featured Projects

- **AvoBackupManager** – Custom backup solution with S3 support & scheduling
- **AvoRotator** – A rotating service display plugin for WordPress homepages
- **AvoMailToForm** – A branded contact form plugin with SMTP, CAPTCHA, and security features
- **Junk Header Remover** – Lightweight tool to clean unnecessary code from WordPress headers
- **AvoTickerNews** – Breaking news ticker plugin pulling fresh WordPress blog posts

> You can find all of them under my GitHub repos, fully open-source and maintained regularly.

## 🧠 Mission & Philosophy

Being Deaf doesn’t stop us — it motivates us. I believe tech should **include**, **empower**, and **represent** the voices that often go unheard. My goal is to lead by example and prove that **Deaf-owned companies** can compete at the highest level — from local hosting to global impact.

At AvocadoWeb, we don’t follow trends. We create them — with transparency, ethics, and community support at our core.

## 🌍 Community & Support

We support:
- **Deaf nonprofits & educational programs** 
- **Startups & Deaf entrepreneurs** through future incubator spaces
- Events like the **WFD 2027 Dubai** and other global accessibility initiatives

We're not just building software. We're building a **movement** — to show the world what Deaf innovation truly looks like.
